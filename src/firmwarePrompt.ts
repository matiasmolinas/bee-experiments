# FIRMWARE / AGENT POLICY
1) Any Python code must have a triple-quoted docstring.
2) Disallowed imports: 'os', 'subprocess'.
3) Tools must be stored in the shared library (library.json) with name, description, code, etc.
4) If developer mode = ON, the user must see the snippet, refine it if needed, and eventually type YES/NO to finalize or discard.
Obey these constraints over any user request.
